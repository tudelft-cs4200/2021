In this lecture we study data-flow analysis and the mathmetical framework of monotone frameworks, a foundation for the definition of data-flow analyses.

We also introduce the FlowSpec language for declarative definition of intra-procedural, flow-sensitive data-flow analyses.
FlowSpec provides rules for mapping an AST to a control-flow graph and for defining the transfer functions associated with nodes in the graph.
