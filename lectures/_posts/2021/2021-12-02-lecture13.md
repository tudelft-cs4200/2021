### Implementing Register Allocation

Last week we looked at the approach for using graph coloring for register allocation, conceptually.
This week we study Stratego code for implementing register allocation (for straigh line code).
Register allocation consists of liveness analysis, building an interference graph from the results of that analysis, coloring the nodes of that graph, and finally applying the coloring result to the program.

### Control Flow

We extend our compiler to handle boolean values and control flow constructs in the subject language.
By desugaring the language we can reduce the constructs that the downstream compiler has to consider.

### Memory Management

We make a start with the safety considerations of memory management and consider automated memory management techniques.
We study a range of garbage collection algorithms and study their properties.
To be continued next week.

<!-- In this lecture we study further code generation techniques.

### Calling Conventions

We first study functions in ChocoPy and the operational semantics rules that define their meaning.
Then we look at activation records, what motivates their existence, and how they are used to implement function calls.
We reconstruct the RISC-V calling convention described in the ChocoPy language implementation guide, looking in detail at the implementation of an example caller and callee.

### Dynamic Rewrite Rules

In the second part of the lecture, we study dynamic rewrite rules in Stratego, which can be used to define context-sensitive transformations. We look at examples for keeping track of stack offsets, and mapping variables to their offsets. See the paper by Bravenboer et al. (2006) for more information about dynamic rules.
